				<h2 class="headline">Company History</h2>
				<p>
					In 2020, A1 Sport founder <a href="#people">John Baker</a> set out to create sporting equipment made from the <em>highest quality materials</em> and backed by scientific and <em>performance research</em> in order to provide a strong basis of <em>quality and reliability</em>.</p>
      <p>His quest began while training for his <em>job in computer science</em>, after exercising and <em>loosing weight</em> that left him much happier. He yearned for <em>simple and high performance gym equipment</em>, in their best form, instead of equipment that <em>breaks easily</em> and does not last. When no products lived up to his strict requirements, John set his sights on <em>creating products</em> that catered to his own vision.</p>
      <p>Today that vision has become A1 Sports which offers a variety of sporting equipment. At the foundation of A1 Sports are products backed by scientific and performance data.
